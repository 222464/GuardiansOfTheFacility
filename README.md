# Guardians of the Facility

**Go deeper and deeper into a facility guarded by strange creatures...**

Source code for Guardians of the Facility, made for Ludum Dare 48.
The code is some of the worst I have ever written, it was quickly hacked together for the jam.
Hopefully the game is at least somewhat interesting.
